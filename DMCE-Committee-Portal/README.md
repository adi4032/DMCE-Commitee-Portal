# DMCE COMMITTEE PORTAL


DMCE Committee Portal is a platform that helps to bring the various committees present in college together, so that students can check out different ongoing events organized by the committees.


## About the Project


DMCE Committee Portal is a website made for the ease of Engineering College students. The site will help students to know  about the functioning of various committees in the college. This is also an initiative to promote the new budding engineers to explore their field and also develop their personality in overall aspects. This is a distinct and a separate place, where students irrespective of their branches and academic year would be able to join and know about the college committees.

The proposed system is a simplistic management system which gives information about various clubs and other helpful activities happening in the college. 
Various opportunities can be availed by the students for their experience and knowledge.
